# NAi Protocol Demo — Decentralized AI Infrastructure

Welcome to the demo smart contracts of **NAi Protocol**, a decentralized infrastructure project combining blockchain governance with real-time AI-based trust scoring. This repository contains simplified and verified contracts used in our testnet deployment for grant applications, auditing, and integration testing.

---

## Overview

NAi Protocol enables:
- ✅ **AI-powered reputation scoring** for nodes and users.
- ✅ **Community-governed DAO** via smart contract proposals.
- ✅ **Reward distribution** for social tasks and uptime-based work.
- ✅ **Vesting and funding logic** for contributors and backers.
- ✅ **Real-time node monitoring** with ban/violation logging.
- ✅ **On-chain logging of all activities and rewards.**

## Contract Architecture

| Contract                            | Purpose |
|-------------------------------------|---------|
| [`NAiToken.sol`](./contracts/NAiToken.sol)               | ERC20 token with capped supply & minting roles |
| [`NAiGovernanceDAO.sol`](./contracts/NAiGovernanceDAO.sol) | Proposal → vote → queue → execute flow |
| [`TimelockController.sol`](./contracts/TimelockController.sol) | Delay mechanism to secure DAO execution |
| [`NAiRewardDistributor.sol`](./contracts/NAiRewardDistributor.sol) | Monthly rewards claimable by users |
| [`MultiTaskRewardVault.sol`](./contracts/MultiTaskRewardVault.sol) | Reward contract for Twitter/Discord tasks |
| [`NAiRewardLogger.sol`](./contracts/NAiRewardLogger.sol)         | On-chain log of distributed rewards (no transfer) |
| [`NAiVestingMulti.sol`](./contracts/NAiVestingMulti.sol)         | Linear vesting with cliff + claimable tracking |
| [`NodeManager.sol`](./contracts/NodeManager.sol)         | Registry of nodes, violations, bans, and removals |

All contracts are written in **Solidity ^0.8.x** and rely on [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts).

> ⚠️ These contracts are deployed during the testnet phase and may be upgraded significantly for the mainnet release.

##  Use Cases

 DAO governance for protocol upgrades  
 Reward distribution based on:
- Social task completion (e.g. Twitter/Discord)
- Node uptime and AI-based performance
- Contributor vesting schedules  
 Tamper-proof logging of bans, violations, and rewards

---

##  Grant Funding Use

This repository supports a non-dilutive grant request (~$10k–$20k) to fund:
- Infrastructure & uptime scoring backend
- Frontend DAO interface & dashboards
- Community education & onboarding tools
